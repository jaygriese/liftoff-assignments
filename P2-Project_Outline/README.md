## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For our project, our group wants to create an app centered on community connectedness.  Our idea is to have an user a profile, events, services, resources, community forum and restaurants section of the website where users can create a custom profile, upload topics for discussion, add/request events, services and resources available as well as view local eats.  Our goal is for each tab to have a search feature as well as forms a user can submit that correspond to the various topics of the website.  Our idea came from one of the group members who proposed a website tailored to volunteer opportunities in the area. From there we expanded the idea to include more features and be tailored to a community as a whole.
